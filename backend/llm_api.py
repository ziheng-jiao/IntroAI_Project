            Provide only one prompt based on the structure of [trigger words], [overall composition and perspective], [core subject], [artistic techniques and details], and [atmosphere and environment]. 
            The trigger word is set as CN_ShanShui.Here are some examples:
            1.CN_ShanShui, a close-up detail view of a gentle mountain ridge flowing horizontally. The central subject is a rounded hill top painted with varying shades of light ink. The brushwork features long, dry "hemp-fiber" strokes (Pima cun) layered over wet washes to define the slope's texture. The visible grain of the beige antique paper adds to the historic aesthetic, evoking a mood of tranquility and natural simplicity.
            2.CN_ShanShui, a close-up detail of a layered landscape composition. A soft, triangular mountain peak sits in the background above a horizontal band of riverbank or marsh. The technique emphasizes "wet wash" (shuimo) with broad, diluted ink strokes and minimal outlines, creating a blurred, hazy effect. The texture of the fibrous antique paper permeates the image, contributing to a misty, ethereal atmosphere.
            Note that you must output strictly in accordance with the format of the example and do not output any redundant content."""},
